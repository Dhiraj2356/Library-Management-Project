# Library-Management-Project
SQL based library management system with relational tables and data analysis

##  Project Overview
This project is a relational **Library Management System** designed using SQL.  
The objective is to manage and analyze library operations such as book issuance, returns, member activity, and employee management by using well-structured tables, foreign key relationships, and SQL queries.

The project demonstrates practical database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying skills.

---

##  Objectives
- Design a relational database for a library system  
- Establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys  
- Perform CRUD operations to manage library data  
- Answer business-related questions using SQL queries  
- Apply advanced SQL concepts for data analysis  

---

##   CRUD Operations
- Inserted sample data across all tables  
- Performed **CRUD operations**:
  - **Create**: Added new books, members, and transactions  
  - **Read**: Retrieved records using SELECT queries  
  - **Update**: Modified existing records such as book status  
  - **Delete**: Removed outdated or incorrect entries  

---

## 📊 Data Analysis & SQL Queries
Solved multiple analytical and operational questions using SQL, such as:
- Books issued and returned by members  
- Frequently issued books  
- Member-wise and branch-wise issue analysis  
- Employee activity related to book issuance  

---

## 🛠 SQL Concepts & Functions Used
- Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)  
- Foreign Key constraints  
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM)  
- GROUP BY and ORDER BY  
- Subqueries for advanced analysis  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified high-activity members based on issue frequency  
- Analyzed book demand using issue and return data  
- Observed branch-wise library activity trends  
- Improved query efficiency by using proper joins and relationships  

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Importance of database normalization and relationships  
- Practical use of foreign keys for data integrity  
- Writing optimized SQL queries for real-world scenarios  
- Translating business questions into SQL logic   

---

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project showcases the implementation of a real-world library management system using SQL, focusing on database design, relational integrity, and analytical querying.
